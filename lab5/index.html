            <h2>What I Have Learned So Far</h2>
            <p>Through this assignment, I've gained a deeper understanding of how HTML is structured. From creating the basic elements to adding content with the right HTML tags, Iâ€™ve learned how to make the content more readable and organized. The use of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> significantly improves the semantic structure of a webpage.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts I've Gained</h3>
            <p>One of the most valuable lessons was how to structure lists effectively. I also learned the importance of headings, especially using <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, and <code>h3</code> tags for content organization. These elements help with both user navigation and search engine optimization (SEO).</p>

            <h3>My To-Do List</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue practicing HTML/CSS</li>
                <li>Explore JavaScript basics</li>
                <li>Experiment with responsive design</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps I've Taken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Completed basic HTML structure</li>
                <li>Uploaded the page to GitHub</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Useful Resource</h3>
            <p>I referred to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> to understand the usage of HTML elements and to troubleshoot any issues I encountered.</p>

            <h2>Lab 03 Reflection</h2>
            <p>This is my reflection on Lab 03. I explored CSS for the first time and learned how to style elements with basic properties like colors, margins, and padding. By creating a webpage with CSS styling, I began to see how the visual layout of a website is shaped.</p>

            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>One challenge was getting the layout to look consistent across browsers. I learned that CSS is quite powerful, but it also requires testing to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.</p>

            <h3>My To-Do List</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refine my CSS skills</li>
                <li>Learn about Flexbox</li>
                <li>Build more responsive websites</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps Taken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Created basic styles for the webpage</li>
                <li>Used external stylesheets to improve page organization</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Lab 05 Reflection</h2>
            <p>For Lab 05, I worked on making my page responsive using Flexbox. I learned how to create layouts that adjust based on screen sizes, making my website more user-friendly across devices.</p>

            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>One challenge was making sure the page maintained a clean layout when switching between mobile and desktop views. I had to adjust the Flexbox settings and tweak the layout to ensure everything looked great on both small and large screens.</p>

            <h3>Steps Taken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Created a flexible layout using Flexbox</li>
                <li>Added a media query for larger screens</li>
            </ol>
