            <h3>Why I Chose This Image</h3>
            <p>I chose this picture because it reflects childhood that came in with the joy and desire to craft a snowman under the cool winter breeze. It brings feelings of nostalgia making you appreciate the little pleasures of winter.
                I choosed the PNG image file type for this season because it reminded me of my chilhood which equally reflected my love for animates.0

<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p>Prior to the begining of this assignment, i did have an idea about the different file extensions but did encounter some difficulties in structuring an working with different extension types in an html.I did have a basic knowlege in css styling and was able to put that into practice for this project</p>
